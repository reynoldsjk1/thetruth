You're not "bad at computers". You're bad at following directions and matching patterns, and you're good at treating computers like sentient beings. Treat the computer as one would treat a calculator or a screwdriver - as a tool to get you results or solve a word problem, not as a problem in itself.

Computers and software expect user input to follow a certain pattern, and output a predictable result. They can't use intuition to say "Oh, the user probably meant to add `.name`, not `.nmae`, let me fix that" ... unless (thanks, elasticsearch) a programmer has taken time out of their day to write code to help a computer look for that specific typo and describe how to handle it. That's right, they weighed the likelihood of your messing up against their time and effort to safeguard against it.

Nothing can be assumed to break "randomly" -- did you open up the code and spot an instance of `Math.random()` in there? -- and computers do not hate you. They simply don't acknowledge the "garbage in" when you try to put square input into a round input field.
